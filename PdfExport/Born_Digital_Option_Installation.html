		<h2>Installation of the Born Digital Conversion Option for PDF Compressor</h2>

		<p>The following conditions must be met for successful installation of the Born Digital
		document conversion option.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				PDF Compressor must be installed on a 32-Bit Windows(TM) Server 2003 or Server 2008 system.<br>
                Microsoft Terminal Services are used and appropriate Microsoft licenses are required.</li>
			<li>
				For conversion of Microsoft Office(TM) Documents the appropriate components of 
				Office 2003 or 2007 must be installed first, such that all Office document 
				types submitted to conversion can be opened.<br></li>
			<li>
				The Born Digital document conversion conflicts with virtual PDF printers 
				installed, such as the LuraDocument PDF Printer. It is strongly recommended to 
				uninstall such printers before installing the LuraDocument PDF Compressor with 
				Born Digital document conversion.<br></li>
			<li>
				Remote Desktop connections must be enabled. This can be done via
				<p>
                    Start&#8594;Control Panel&#8594;System Properties&#8594;Remote.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Ensure that security settings relating to Terminal Services ("Local Policies", 
						"User Rights Assignments") are set to "Allow log on through Terminal Services".</li>
					<li>
						Verify Terminal Services Configuration in "Administrative Tools". 
						The following restriction in "Server Settings" must not apply: "Restrict each user to one session".
						For connection RDP-TCP the properties have to allow automatic logon.
						"Always prompt for password" must be disabled in Logon Settings.</li>
					<li>
						If using Windows (TM) Server 2008, the role "Terminal Services" must be installed
						and enabled. This can be done through Start&#8594;Manage Your Server&#8594;Add or remove a role.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				Before installing PDF Compressor Enterprise, create dedicated user account(s) for 
				conversion worker sessions.
				<ul>
					<li>
						You should create one such account per processor core licensed for conversion.</li>
					<li>
						The accounts can be local or regular domain user accounts, but they must
						belong to the "Remote Users" group which can also be configured via
						"Administrative Tools". In any case, please verify that all accounts can
						log in remotely.</li>
					<li>
					    The accounts must have sufficient permissions to access the actual files
					    to convert. 
					<li>
						It is highly preferable to create new accounts upon installation and not to use 
						pre-existing ones or share accounts of actual desktop users.</li>
					<li>
						After installation the worker service accounts should not be used to log on 
						interactively - this is likely to interfere with the Born Digital conversion 
						process!</li>
					<li>
						Supply the accounts with non-empty passwords and note the user names and 
						passwords. You will be prompted to enter them during PDF Compressor 
						installation and you must specify them in fully-qualified form there, either
						as &lt;computer name&gt;\&lt;user name&gt; for local users or
						&lt;domain name&gt;\&lt;user name&gt; for domain users.
						</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				Log in to each of the service accounts via Remote Desktop (mstsc.exe) and start 
				each of the installed Office applications.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Verify that all required input file types can be opened properly in Microsoft 
						Office(TM) (e.g. open a .WPD document in Word, an .SVG document in Visio, etc.). 
						This procedure is required to complete the Office installation and to ensure 
						its completeness.</li>
					<li>
						In Microsoft Office Outlook(TM) take care to disable automatic features (such as 
						"AutoArchive" or automatic printing of mail attachments) for each of the 
						service accounts.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				Once this procedure has been completed you are ready to install PDF Compressor 
				with the Born Digital document conversion option.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Keep the list of worker service account names and passwords at hand as you are 
						required to enter them during installation.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                    </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
            <li>
                When using Windows (TM) Server 2008, after installing the PDF Compressor the executable O2PWSC.exe
                in the PDF Compressor installation directory must be added to the list of remote applications under
                Start&#8594;Control Panel&#8594;Terminal Services&#8594;Terminal Services Remote App Manager.
                It is essential to select the "Allow any command-line arguments" option in this application's
                properties.
            </li>
        </ol>
